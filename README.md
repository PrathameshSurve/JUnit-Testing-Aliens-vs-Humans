## Project Title: Entity Interaction Simulator

### Overview:
This Java project simulates interactions between entities, specifically Humans and Aliens, within a controlled environment. The project is designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance, encapsulation, and testing using JUnit.

### Project Structure:
1. **Entity Class:** Contains shared traits and abilities common to both Humans and Aliens, such as health, damage, and skills.
2. **Human Class:** Inherits from the Entity class and introduces unique traits for Humans, like armor and human-specific abilities.
3. **Alien Class:** Also inherits from the Entity class and implements unique traits for Aliens, including health regeneration and alien-specific abilities.
4. **Environment Class:** Manages interactions between entities and provides a structured environment for entities to interact. It can be extended to manage other game elements.

### Key Features:
- Creation of entities with shared and unique traits.
- Handling of interactions between entities within an environment.
- A structured testing approach using JUnit for thorough code validation.

### How to Use:
1. Clone or download the project from this GitHub repository.
2. Import the project into your Java development environment.
3. Run the JUnit test classes (`TestEntity`, `TestHuman`, `TestAlien`, and `TestEnvironment`) to validate the functionality of each class.
4. Explore the code and adapt it for your own projects or game simulations.
